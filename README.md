Ray tracer in Rust
==================

This repository contains an implementation of a simple ray tracer written
in Rust. It supports rendering scenes containing multiple spheres of random
sizes and colors, and a checkered plane to serve as a floor. It can produce
reflections and shadows.

This was written in order to practice Rust, so there might be some suboptimal
solutions here.
